A simple space-themed trading simulator made with tkinter and my first python project.

The general GUI structrure is based on a [assignment](https://informatik.bildung-rp.de/fileadmin/user_upload/informatik.bildung-rp.de/Fortbildung/FB_SpieleProgrammieren/SPIELE-171017-Jakobs_Modul1SpiceWars.pdf) from the German ministry of Education, but i've changed both the GUI and the gameplay a lot since what's provided by the assignment.

I know that the game could be coded simplier and prettier, but I'm still learning.

### Installation
Download the repo as .zip, unpack it and `cd` into the folder. Run the game with `python3 game.py`.
