# Space Wars

Space Wars is a simple space-themed trading simulator made with tkinter and my first python project.

The general GUI structrure is based on a [assignment](https://informatik.bildung-rp.de/fileadmin/user_upload/informatik.bildung-rp.de/Fortbildung/FB_SpieleProgrammieren/SPIELE-171017-Jakobs_Modul1SpiceWars.pdf) from the German ministry of Education, but i've changed both the GUI and the gameplay a lot since what's provided by the assignment.

### Installation
Download the repo (and move into the new folder) with `git clone https://github.com/DD-65/Space-Wars && cd Space-Wars`.
Start the game with `python3 game.py`. 
Have fun playing!
