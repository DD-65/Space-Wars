# Space-Wars
![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes!-brightgreen)

A simple space-themed trading simulator aka my first (bigger) python project.

The general GUI structrure is based on a [assignment](https://informatik.bildung-rp.de/fileadmin/user_upload/informatik.bildung-rp.de/Fortbildung/FB_SpieleProgrammieren/SPIELE-171017-Jakobs_Modul1SpiceWars.pdf) from the German ministry of Education, but i've changed both the GUI and the gameplay a lot from the assignment.

I know that the game could have a lot of additional features and that I could code simplier and prettier, but I'm still learning.
